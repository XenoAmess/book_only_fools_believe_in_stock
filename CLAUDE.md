# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Chinese-language e-book project titled "只有弱智才买股票" (Only Fools Buy Stocks). It's a markdown-based documentation project using IntelliJ IDEA as the development environment.

## Project Structure

- `readme.md` - Project description (Chinese)
- `kimi.md` - Contains CLI command reference (`claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`)
- `src/` - Main content file (currently empty)
- `.idea/` - IntelliJ IDEA project configuration
- `book_only_fools_believe_in_stock.iml` - IntelliJ module file

## Development Commands

Since this is a documentation project, there are no build, test, or lint commands. The primary workflow involves:

1. **Content Creation**: Write and edit markdown files, primarily `src/summary.md`
2. **IDE Operations**: Use IntelliJ IDEA for editing and file management
3. **Git Operations**: Standard git commands for version control

## Architecture Notes

This is a simple documentation project with no complex architecture:
- Markdown content files in `src/`
- No build system or dependencies
- No testing framework
- Uses IntelliJ IDEA project structure for organization

The book content should be written in Chinese and focuses on stock market investment topics.

书的主题是描述二级市场不关联任何生产实际,只是虚无的经济泡沫.
